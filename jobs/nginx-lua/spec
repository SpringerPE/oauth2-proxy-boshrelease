      'auth_basic_user_file auth/registry;'". The format of each user is
      "user:password" (for passwords encrypted with 'htpasswd'). If you want
      to use plain passwords then the format is "user:{PLAIN}password"
    default: []
  nginx-lua.lua:
    description: |
      List of lua programs. You can define as many lua files as you need. Each entry
      within "content" key will be a file. Note you can use full paths to other
      lua files provided by other jobs, just indicating the full path: /var/vcap ...
      Keys required for each entry: 'name' and 'content'
  nginx-lua.sites:
    description: |
      List of nginx vhots. You can define as many config files as you need. Each entry
      within "config" key will be a file. Note you can use full paths to other
      nginx config files provided by other jobs, just indicating the full path: /var/vcap ...

  nginx-lua.tls_key:
    description: |
      The TLS key in PEM format. Its location is 'certs/key.pem',
      also available as env variable "${TLS_KEY}".
  nginx-lua.tls_crt:
    description: |
      This is the chained TLS certificate for the website; This is in PEM
      format.  The topmost certificate should be the certificate for the
      website itself.  (e.g. in the case of sslip.io, the certificate for
      sslip.io). The second-from-top certificate should be the intermediate
      certificate (e.g.  "COMODO RSA Domain Validation Secure Server CA"). If
      there is another intermediate certificate, that should follow (e.g.
      "COMODO RSA Certification Authority").  There is no reason to include the
      root certificate, but there is no harm in including it either. It should
      be the last certificate (bottom-most). Its location is 'certs/crt.pem',
      also available as env variable "${TLS_CRT}".
